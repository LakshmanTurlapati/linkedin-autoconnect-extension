## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Dive under the hood and see the magic behind the curtain:

1. **Manifest Configuration:**
   - Utilizes `manifest_version` 3 for the latest Chrome extension standards.
   - Defines necessary permissions like `activeTab` and `scripting` to interact with LinkedIn pages.

2. **Content Script (`content.js`):**
   - **Template Management:** Stores an array of predefined message templates with placeholders for dynamic content.
   - **Dynamic Population:** Replaces placeholders like `$name` and `$sender` with actual recipient and sender names using the `populateTemplate` function.
   - **Name Extraction:** Implements multiple methods to accurately extract the recipient's name from different parts of the LinkedIn page, ensuring reliability.
   - **Widget Injection:** Adds a stylish shuffle icon to the message box, allowing users to switch templates on the fly. This includes:
     - Injecting Font Awesome for iconography.
     - Styling the widget for optimal placement and aesthetics.
     - Adding event listeners for interactive functionality.
   - **Mutation Observer:** Monitors the DOM for the appearance of the connection request modal and triggers the message population and widget injection accordingly.

3. **Popup Script (`popup.js`):**
   - **Shuffle Functionality:** Listens for clicks on the shuffle button in the popup and executes a script in the active tab to shuffle the message template.
   - **User Feedback:** Provides real-time status updates to inform users of successful template shuffles.

4. **Future Enhancements:**
   - **Custom Template Uploads:** Upcoming feature allowing users to upload their own `templates.json` files for personalized messaging.
   - **Enhanced UI/UX:** Continuous improvements to the widget and popup interfaces for an even smoother user experience.
